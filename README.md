PianobarControl
===============

This is a wrapper around [pianobar](https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar) for OS X. It currently depeds on [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) (which depends on `X11`) to choose stations. `dmenu` can be installed using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Also, a proper =eventcmd= should be set (I use `pianobar-notify-osx` from [here](https://github.com/jcmuller/pianobar-notify)).
