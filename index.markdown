PianobarControl
===============

This is a wrapper around [pianobar](https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar) for OS X. It currently depends on an appropriate `eventcmd` to be set in `$HOME/.config/pianobar/config` (I use `pianobar-notify-osx` from [here](https://github.com/jcmuller/pianobar-notify)).

There is a global hot key: `Shift + Option + P`
